Object Detector :
An object detector Python project is a computer vision application that is able to identify and locate objects within an image or video stream. This is an Object Detection Python project that uses the YOLOv4-tiny model to detect objects from a live camera feed. The user interface includes buttons for the user to select which objects they want to detect.
Installation :
Prerequisites :
Python 3.x OpenCV 4.x
Instructions :
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/ayan-joshi/object-detector.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the program: python object_detector.py
How to Use:
When the program starts, the camera feed will open up in a new window. To select which objects to detect, click on the corresponding button in the user interface. Only the selected objects will be detected and displayed in the camera feed. Multiple objects can be detected at a same time and give proper accuracy as well. Press the ESC key to exit the program.
