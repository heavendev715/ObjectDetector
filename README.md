# objectdetector
An object detector Python project is a computer vision application that is able to identify and locate objects within an image or video stream. 
These types of projects are typically used in a wide range of industries, such as self-driving cars, robotics, surveillance, and image search.
There are many popular libraries and frameworks for object detection in Python, such as TensorFlow Object Detection API, OpenCV, and Darknet. These libraries provide pre-trained models and helpful tools to make it easier to train and use object detectors.
